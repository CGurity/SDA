After executing the activities proposed in this manual, we will have fully equipped the organization with criteria and instruments to begin a coherent and robust security plan. It is important to highlight that the policies and procedures developed in this manual represent just a **first approach** to the development of a formal security plan and as long as the organization feels comfortable, it should be deepened and complemented with other aspects and strategies that cover the missing spaces in the proposed methodology.

In addition to materialize formal policies on organizational security, it is recommended to consult references on information security and complement the development of policies and procedures with the generation of security training plan for the entire team of the organization. This training process can help to maintain in a more effective way the policies and procedures developed as well as an adequate integration of security principles in the daily processes of the organization.
