# Acceptable use policy to accounts and passwords

Estimated time: 15 min

## Justification
Currently, most organizations use technology within their processes, this technology inevitably has vulnerabilities and is prone to fail or be abused. Taking this into account, the idea of this policy is to provide safe use guidelines to the entry points of any member of the team, both at the level of devices and services on the Internet to protect the organization in the best possible way. Specifically, basic security measures in the use of mobile or desktop devices are described, widely used services such as email and social networks, the construction, and management of passwords and other means of authentication within the organization.

## Input data
* Data protection policy.
* [Template 2: Acceptable use policy for computers, accounts, and passwords](https://sdamanual.org/es/plantillas/p2) available in the physical or digital form to be filled in during the course of the activity.

## Associated Concepts
* **Software updates:**  Partial code patches for the operating system that seek to improve functionality and correct new security vulnerabilities.
* **Encryption:** Ability to transform a message into something unintelligible for others, but also being able to revert it to the original content by those who must have access to the data.
* **Disc or device encryption:** Process that allows encrypting the entire contents of a computer's hard disk in such a way that it is only accessible and usable when a password or other authentication method is applied when switching on.
* **Pirated Software:** Any software that is installed out of the official channels without paying their licensing value.
* **Malware:** Any malicious software that executes actions on a computer without authorization from its owner or responsible party.
* **Phishing:** A series of attacks that use identity theft as a mechanism to get a user to perform an action harmful to oneself, the equipment used, the data stored and network linked to.
* **Password:** Sequence of secret characters that are used to enter a service or device.
* **Credentials:** the union of usernames and passwords, are given to identify a user. These credentials increasingly include other factors such as biometric aspects and temporary security codes.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Technology that allows treating equipment that can be in remote locations as part of an internal network, frequently used by organizations to unite in a single network several computers in dispersed locations. A particular application of this technology allows private users to encrypt the content of their Internet connections between their devices and places considered safe before reaching the Internet, they are generally used to protect surveillance traffic and access to blocked content.
* **Tor:** Network infrastructure that allows surfing the internet redirecting data by random points around the world. These data travel encrypted and the system is designed to provide anonymity and protection against surveillance.
* **URL:** Character sequences that allow locating resources on the internet, it means Universal Resource Locator. *http: //sdamanual.org* is an example of URL.
* **Antivirus:** Software that analyzes files in searching for known pieces of malware. They generally hold a database of previously identified threats, then compare file by file with this database to detect any possible matches.
* **PGP / GnuPG / GPG:** A set of technologies that allow applying principles of asymmetric encryption (which is considered much more secure than traditional techniques) to messages and files in computer equipment. It is generally used as an advanced security strategy given the effort required for its implementation and the high level of security it provides.
* **Password Manager:** Software that allows you to store previously designed passwords and recover them when needed. Generally they allow generating passwords with much greater length and complexity since it is not necessary to remember them at the moment of their use.
* **Authentication in 2 factors or authentication in 2 steps:** Authentication technique based on request to enter a service in addition to a password, another element related to something that the user physically possesses, such as a cell phone, a physical token, a card with codes, etc.

## Policies to be developed
The **Acceptable use policy, accounts, and passwords** to be developed in this activity, abstracts existing contents in the following policies described in standardized reference frames:
* **Equipment Acceptable Use Policy:** Defines basic conditions for safe use of computers, telephones, and other mobile equipment. It usually deals with topics such as access passwords, computer lock, encrypt and incident reporting among others.
* **Internet acceptable use policy:** It establishes some security principles related to the use of browsers and other applications that connect to the internet in order to protect both equipment and data contained in it.
* **Policy for acceptable use of electronic mail:** Establishes specific guidelines for the use of electronic mail. In principle, it seeks to reduce phishing attacks, exfiltration of information and computer infections by malware, it may also include guidelines for the purposes in which mail, language, and other relevant aspects are used to a proper use of electronic mail in the organization.
* **Social network acceptable use policy:** Determines security measures to be taken in the use and administration of the organization's social networks. It usually has a set of general rules and other specific rules for each service of interest.
* **Account and password policy:** This policy establishes a set of rules that govern the creation, use, and maintenance of passwords in different services and access to devices, in case the organization manages some of its own systems, you can specify a password management guidelines for your users. Sometimes, this policy also considers aspects other than passwords, such as biometrics or other authentication factors.

## Guiding questions
1. What is the scope of the proposed policy?
* Who does this policy affect?
* Does it include equipment owned by the organization or any other equipment used to work on it?
* Does it include computers or mobile devices?
* What email and social media services are included?
2. Who is responsible for implementing and maintaining security measures in the equipment?
3. What are the general safety measures and directives on the management of equipment?
4. What are the general security considerations when using any communication channel?
5. What are the general security measures when using the internet?

### 1. Scope of the policy
In summary, the scope associated with this policy covers the following aspects:

* To which people this policy impact: generally all members of the organization and allies who work on specific projects are included.
* What equipment impacts the policy:
   * If there is only equipment include that is owned by the organization or if it also includes the equipment owned by the members of the organization used for professional purposes (work model *Bring your own equipment* or Bring Your Own Device - BYOD in English).
   * If it includes computers and/or phones and other mobile equipment.
* What type of digital services covers: whether it includes email, general internet use, social networks or any other service that is relevant to the organization. A valid option can also be all services that are used to work in the organization.

In this section, the contents of section (1) of the policy template for acceptable use of computers, accounts, and passwords should be discussed, modified and approved. It is very important that the provisions established in this and the other policies developed are aligned with the rest, in this case with the data protection policy which can provide help when deciding specific guidelines.

### 2. Equipment responsibility
> Who is responsible for implementing and maintaining security measures in the equipment?

Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (2) of the policy template for acceptable use of equipment, accounts, and passwords that deals with the ownership of the equipment and the responsibilities for using them and reporting incidents.
* The most notable variation in this step depends on whether the organization has its own equipment, all the equipment are owned by the members of the organization (BYOD) or a mixture of both modalities. In the template, there are several examples that can be reduced to the particular case of the organization executing the activity.

### 3. General equipment use
> What are the general safety measures and directives on the management of equipment?

Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (3) of the policy template for acceptable use of computers, accounts, and passwords. Some of the most important aspects discussed in this section are:

* Authentication means for equipment such as passwords or biometrics.
* Blocking equipment when left unattended.
* Sharing credentials for equipment access.
* Operating system updates.
* Use of pirated software.
* Considerations against malware infection.
* Disk encryption.
  * On computers.
  * On cell phones and other mobile devices
* Use of equipment for purposes other than the work of the organization.
* Use Antivirus and Antimalware.

#### Equipment Acceptable Use Directives

Discuss, modify and approve the section of directives in section (3) of the corresponding policy template. It is ideal that the group has prior knowledge of specific security issues, being the optimal case to have this discussion after the completion of a digital security workshop, and as each aspect worked in this manual is covered, you can discuss how to implement this concept or tool to the corresponding policy. Take for examples those listed in the template that can be used as they appear, edited or eliminated are, among others:

* The mandatory use of user passwords on computers and cell phones used to address sensitive issues of the organization. These passwords must comply with the password policies at the end of this document.
* The mandatory use of screen protectors that block users of computers and cell phones after a certain period of inactivity.
* The implementation of system encryption: in the case of mobile devices this feature is often activated by default and in the case of computers it may require time, knowledge and special effort to implement an effective disk encryption. In this aspect, it is common to concentrate efforts on those computers that handle highly sensitive data, on equipment maintenance plans that consider the configuration of this disk encryption or on the use of operating systems that facilitate system encryption by design.
* The policy of operating system updates: It is generally considered as the minimum necessary to make automated security updates, from that point on it is possible to adjust the policy to each organization according to specific needs.
* Use antivirus and antimalware software, being able to specify specific approved software or selection criteria.

### 4. About the use of any communication channel
> What are the general security considerations when using any communication channel?

Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (4) of the corresponding template. Some of the most important aspects discussed in this section are:

* The handling of highly sensitive data through these channels and towards external stakeholders of the organization.
* Use of equipment for purposes other than work related to the organization.
* The attitude of the organization's members when using official communication channels. Attitudes regarding discrimination, harassment, spam, etc. in the communication channels used for organizational purposes.
* Provisions on the use of the equipment to carry out actions that violate the intellectual property rights and copy or distribute material protected by copyright.

### 5. Internet general purpose directives
> What are the general security measures when using the internet?
Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (5) of the corresponding template. In case some consideration does not apply to the organization, it can be eliminated without any consequence. Some of the most important aspects discussed in this section are:

* The use of circumvention and anonymity instruments on the internet when using computers such as Virtual Private Networks (or VPNs in English), Tor or other similar tools. Normally these measures are associated with levels of sensitivity of the data handled. Since it is a directive, it can be specific in approved point tools or selection criteria.
* The prohibition of activities that unjustifiably deteriorate the quality of the connection (for example, downloading torrents or streaming content not related to work).

#### Strategies against identity theft
Given that the most frequent attacks on organizations today are largely related to phishing attacks, it is important to specify clear strategies to face these risks. It is proposed to review in section (5) of the template in use the corresponding section and discuss, edit, add and approve some of the proposed strategies, related to topics such as:

* Knowledge throughout the organization of the official communication channels of the relevant stakeholders (e.g. Suppliers, staff, public institutions) and avoid any communication or exchange of sensitive information through different channels. (Email addresses, accounts in social networks and telephone numbers among others).
* The management of communications that request sensitive data such as credentials, banking, and personal information, as well as the development of a series of indicators that help detect possible cases of identity theft.
* The development of rules for handling suspicious attachments.

### 6. Account management
> What are the general security considerations to follow in the management of user accounts?

Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (6) of the policy template for acceptable use of computers, accounts and passwords. Some of the most important aspects discussed in this section are:

* Obligation of individual or shared accounts.
* Responsibility for the use of own accounts.
* Implementation of the principle of minimum privilege in the creation and configuration of user accounts.
* Management of account recovery mechanisms.

### 7. Management of accounts in self-managed services (internal systems, hosted websites, servers, etc.)
> What security policies should be implemented with services self-managed by the organization?

Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (7) of the policy template for acceptable use of computers, accounts and passwords. Some of the most important aspects discussed in this section are:

* Concept of administrators: who creates, monitors, controls and eliminates an account and under what circumstances ?.
* Who authorizes the creation of the accounts.
* Avoid administrative accounts for daily use.
* Non-disclosure agreements (NDA).
* System access roles.

### 8. Directives on management of accounts in third-party services (e-mails, social networks, collaboration services, etc.)
> What are the security guidelines that should be followed when managing accounts in services hosted by third parties?

Discuss, modify and approve the content of section (8) of the policy template for acceptable use of computers, accounts, and passwords. Some of the most important aspects discussed in this section are:

#### About the email
