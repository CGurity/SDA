For many years now, organizations that defend human rights and emerging media have faced a myriad of threats and potential threats, whether from authoritarian states, business interests, extremist organizations or affected groups, among many others. Taking this into account, a need for security in operations of this type of organizations has only grown, increasing exponentially in the last decade when integration of different technological solutions available to operations of organizations becomes more widespread. Meanwhile, from the private industry and regulatory bodies, they began to develop specifications, frameworks and methodologies to generate security policies and protocols that would adequately protect data and resources of companies and enforce them with the law. However, the frameworks developed were extremely complex, long and expensive to implement for most civil society organizations that frequently manage tight budgets and inconstant funding cycles, which led to implementation of formal security policies that were exclusive and distant for most civil society organizations.

To attack this problem, many initiatives emerged that sought to increase the knowledge on information security towards civil society, organizations and activists, helping to generate criteria for tools selection and process design, implementing measures to safeguard information and other means. Some of these initiatives went further and generated methodologies to assess the organizations' security level, adapt content to specific groups or offer tools to the actual growing community of facilitators and coaches that serve organizations that most need to implement security in their operations. Although the appearance of these initiatives meant a crucial improvement for the security of the beneficiary organizations, there are still some spaces where the scope of the security strategies can be optimized, above all so that they last over time.

This manual endeavor to fill some of these gaps by adapting and simplifying methodologies available under private industry standards, mixing them along with other existing materials in the security area designed for civil society organizations and also with experience of several information security instructors in field with human rights defenders, organizations and independent media in Latin America for almost five years in a row at the time of publication of this manual. More specifically, this manual deliberately excludes certain processes and policies widely addressed in materials aimed at private industry in order to reduce to the essential the amount of activities and time that must be spent on its execution, understanding that the target organizations usually lack of time, resources or personnel to develop a security strategy as rigorous as proposed by standards such as NIST, COBIT or ISO among others. In the event that any organization wishes to deepen the development of security policies and strategies beyond this manual, in the references section, links or contents are made available in order to develop frameworks and methodologies to build documentation on security for organizations.
