This book is a practical guide written to be used by information security facilitators who wish to complement their training and/or accompaniment work in civil society organizations (especially human rights defenders and independent media). However, it can be applied by people within this type of organization, external facilitators not directly related to information security who are interested in the subject and practically any interested person that feels comfortable in following the instructions of these activities.

The content of this guide can also be adapted to any other type of organization that handles sensitive information, desires to increase security in the handling of it, and wishes to document security policies that last over time.

## Objectives of this guide's application
1. Establish security policies and protocols for civil society organizations adapted to their operations, and respond to the needs of their changing contexts and future projection.
2. Increase the understanding of the security context within the members of civil society organizations at risk.
3. Introduce civil society organizations (especially organizations defending human rights and independent media) in the threat model, risk analysis, and any other basic methodologies for surveying and assessing the level of organizational security.
