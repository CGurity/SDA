## How is the manual structured?
This manual is divided into 3 main sections, which contain a group of activities:

The first section seeks to explore the context of the organization and some of its internal processes, once the information is collected, the foundations of the organization's first security policies are established (Information classification policy and data retention policy).

The second section develops one by one other security policies through facilitated activities, while the third section introduces and guides the construction of concepts for threat models and security protocols, emphasizing the creation of risk matrices, succession plans, communications and protocol sequence.

At the end a section of references is exposed collecting links of projects, bibliographies and initiatives that complement the activities covered, as well as the next steps to extend, deepen and polish policies constructed from this material.

In each one of the sections we propose a set of activities that explain the facilitation process that must be followed to generate the proposed products, each activity has the following information:
* **Estimated time** of completion of the activity, which may vary depending on the size of the group, the skill of the facilitator and the steps considered in each activity to execute.
* **Previous planning** of the activity in terms of research or data collection of the organization.
* **Materials** required to execute the activity.
* **Instructions** of the activity, normally in a sequence of steps, listing actions to be carried out along with descriptive graphics if applied.
* **Closure of the activity** a summary of what has been achieved, and also what the generated products will serve to.
* **References** made during the development of the activity.
