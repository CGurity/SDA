The idea behind this step of the methodology is to create the basis to develop all the minimum security policies of the organization. Although ideally this step should be applied at the moment of conception of the organization, this methodology is built and written to be applied in existing organizations.

Among the activities that make up this step are:

	A. Documentation of the objectives of the organization.
	B. Survey of stakeholder and data mapping.
	C. Definition of security objectives (Review how it is provided).
	D. Definition of basic security policies (classification of information, data retention, acceptable use of devices, management of accounts and passwords).
	E. Definition of security policies.
