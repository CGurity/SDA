title: Model of threats

### Threat model
The idea behind this is to use inputs of the first phase to build a risk matrix that considers the threats that the organization faces, and thus validate that security objectives, map of stakeholders and data mapping are consistent with all that is being documented throughout this analysis. It also seeks to confirm that basic security policies are capable of mitigating any possible threat.

### Protocols
Depending on the threats detected in phase 2, the work team will be able to decide which of these may require the assignment of an emergency protocol. For each one of them elaborate at least:

	A. Succession planning: how responsibilities are distributed during the emergency.
	B. Steps to follow: sequence of activities followed to execute the protocol.
	C. Communication plan: defining who within the team communicates what to certain external actors during the emergency, must also understand the internal communication means of the team.
	D. Documentation of evidence: for each case, what can be collected and how, to serve as an internal input, for further analysis, judicial evidence or information to help recover from the incident.
	E. Frequency of protocol revision.
